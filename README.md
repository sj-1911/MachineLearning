# MachineLearning

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This Python script builds a neural network using TensorFlow to predict binary outcomes. It preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates performance using accuracy and loss metrics. Hyperparameter tuning is included to optimize model configuration, and a plot of training vs. validation loss is generated.
